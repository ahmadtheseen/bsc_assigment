Real-world problem: Planning a trip

Steps using computational thinking:
1. Decompose the task into parts â€” destination, travel method, accommodation, and budget.
2. Gather information and compare options (flights, hotels, prices).
3. Create an algorithm: 
   - Choose destination
   - Book flight
   - Reserve hotel
   - Pack luggage
4. Execute and test â€” follow the plan, and adjust if there are delays or changes.
